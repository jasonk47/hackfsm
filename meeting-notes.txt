making something that's useful to historians

making something that's more accessible to more general audience
    very visual
    basic/summarised information that high-school/midle-school kids could use
        Berkeley retirees
    visually appealing
    highlights the archive enough to inspire understanding of what archives are
    use pop-up archives' wealth of different media types
    middle school/high school rule of thumb
        kids remember 10% of what they hear
        20% of what they see
        % increases logarithmically when you combine see/hear/write
        writing increases learning up to 75%-ish

timeline idea
    link things with respect to time
    the API gives us collections
        ex: "all Daily Cal articles 1963-1967, involving FSM"

general ideas - these are like links at the top of a page
    people
        all people?
        top 10 people?
        randomly assign images, sound, document, etc at request time
        keep information fresh on every page
        perhaps pull Wikipedia information
    places
    groups
    events
        specifically, first occurrences

graphs
    lexical analysis of documents
        mentions of the Free Speech movement over time in articles, etc
    let the user define searches/graphs
    overlay main events of the movemement over graphs like this
    economics
    demographics/racial inequality

crossover. Black Panther movement over FSM
    common names, common dates between the two terms

wommen of the FSM
    terribly underrepresented in the currently-available materials
    Berkeley has been co-ed from the start, unlike nearly all top-level schools

events are effected by the events prior, and also effect the events following
    ex: after this fiasco, what was the turnover in the administration?
    basically, we don't want to focus PURELY on dates at which the FSM was happening
    involve data from around the bay area in this date range

look for pre-made data sets involving FSM stuff

questions
    what's going on with immigrants/workforce?
    what are the other movements going on at the time?
    the public's conscience was overburdened
        everyone asking for everything; we learn to shrug
